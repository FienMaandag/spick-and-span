Spick-and-Span

The Problem and the Solution

Spick-and-Span is the app for everyone living with multiple people and having trouble keeping the house clean, this could be a big student house or a larger family. In this app you can add rooms and tasks that need to be fulfilled for this room. It is also possible to mark the cleaning duty done. By doing so you can earn points with which you can compare how much everyone has done in the house. This resolves the problem of uncertainty about who has done enough in the house. The app also keeps track of which tasks are most urgent, solving the problem of uncertainty about what should be done in the house.

Review

One app has been found that serves a similar purpose as the proposed app which is called “Clean Freak Cleaning Schedule” since it wasn’t free the review is based on the description. It shows a list with chores that need to be done and the amount of days ago that is has been since the chore is done. It is a very basic version of the proposed app. The shown screenshot also shows a very basic layout design for an older version of software. The basis that is used in the “Clean Freak Cleaning Schedule” app can be used in the proposed app. Although it would need a lot of updating with the added functionality like the point system and the division of tasks in rooms.

Minimum Viable Product

The parts of the application that define the MVP are firstly the possibility to create and join a house. Secondly the ability to add tasks and mark tasks as done. And thirdly the option to see how urgently a task has to be fulfilled.
Optional parts that could be added to this app are functionalities like:

•	Rankings: Be a bathroom queen or roommate of the month

•	Rewards for earning a lot of points: Change your points for rewards like a beer or a home cooked meal.

•	Advanced point system: Do a tasks exactly on the day it should be done and get extra points.

•	History: Who has done which tasks.
