# Spick an Span
Spick-and-Span by Fien Maandag

# Purpose
Spick-and-Span is an app for people who share a household. It helps the user keep track of what tasks need to be done in the house and whoâ€™s turn it is to do some tasks. The user can create a house with rooms, tasks for each room and assigning a frequency and points to each task. It is a positively orientated solution for a schedule on paper. It is positively orientated because it does not force anyone to do certain tasks at certain moments but instead positively reinforces people for doing tasks. Spick-and-Span is also an improvement relative to a paper schedule since it gives the opportunity to do the tasks in the house that you prefer, give more exact information about which tasks need to be done and provides a clear overview of the tasks done and by who they are done.
