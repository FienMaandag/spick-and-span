# Report about Spick-and-Span by Fien Maandag

## Short Description
Spick-and-Span is an app for people who share a household. It helps the user keep track of what tasks need to be done in the house and who’s turn it is to do some tasks. The user can create a house with rooms, tasks for each room and assigning a frequency and points to each task. It is a positively orientated solution for a paper schedule. It is positively orientated because it does not force anyone to do certain tasks at certain moments but instead positively reinforces people for doing tasks. Spick-and-Span is also an improvement relative to a paper schedule since it gives the opportunity to do the tasks in the house that you prefer, give more exact information about which tasks need to be done and provides a clear overview of the tasks done and by who they are done.

## Technical Design


## To Do
Clearly describe the technical design: how is the functionality implemented in your code? This should be like your DESIGN.md but updated to reflect the final application. First, give a high level overview, which helps us navigate and understand the total of your code (which components are there?). Second, go into detail, and describe the modules/classes/functions and how they relate.
Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month.
Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?
