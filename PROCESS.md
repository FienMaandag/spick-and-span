# Process Book

In this document the process of building the Spick and Span app will be documented.

# Day 2
The idea of the app was defined today. An important decision was to make a point based app instead of a schedule based app. This decision was made because it seemed like a more original and unique concept and also more of an addition to the regular pen and paper solution. The decision was also made to let the users join a house via a secret code that is generated when a house is created.

# Day 3
Today the layout was created in Xcode. A change in the layout was changing the hamburger menu option to a tab bar on the bottom of the page. This decision was made because it is more IOS like. Because of this the options leave house, logout and secret code have been merged together to a tab settings.

# Day 4
Today the design document was setup. The database was structured and the first step for a functioning login was made.
